    In the zero-temperature limit sinkhorn(log_alpha/temp) approaches
    a permutation matrix. Therefore, for low temperatures this method can be
    seen as an approximate sampling of permutation matrices, where the
    distribution is parameterized by the matrix log_alpha
    The deterministic case (noise_factor=0) is also interesting: it can be
    shown that lim t->0 sinkhorn(log_alpha/t) = M, where M is a
    permutation matrix, the solution of the
    matching problem M=arg max_M sum_i,j log_alpha_i,j M_i,j.
    Therefore, the deterministic limit case of gumbel_sinkhorn can be seen
    as approximate solving of a matching problem, otherwise solved via the
    Hungarian algorithm.
    Warning: the convergence holds true in the limit case n_iters = infty.
    Unfortunately, in practice n_iter is finite which can lead to numerical
    instabilities, mostly if temp is very low. Those manifest as
    pseudo-convergence or some row-columns to fractional entries (e.g.
    a row having two entries with 0.5, instead of a single 1.0)
    To minimize those effects, try increasing n_iter for decreased temp.
    On the other hand, too-low temperature usually lead to high-variance in
    gradients, so better not choose too low temperatures.
