Causal Discovery with Missing Data

To train our model on setting 1, 
```
python main.py 1 train
```

To evaluate our model on setting 1, 

```
python main.py 1 eval
```

On the first run, a synthetic dataset following configurations in `config.py` will be created. The codes for generating synthetic data are copied from MissDAG.
