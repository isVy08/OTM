Causal Discovery with Missing Data

Linear model
```
solver.py
```

Non-linear model

For example, running causal discovery on setting MLP-ER1
```
python main.py 1 ER mlp
```

On the first run, a synthetic dataset following configurations in `config.py` will be created. The codes for generating synthetic data are copied from MissDAG.
